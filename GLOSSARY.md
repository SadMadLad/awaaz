# Terms and Definitions for Audio Processing

- **PCM (Pulse Code Modulation):** A method to convert analog audio signals into digital form by sampling the signal's amplitude at regular intervals.
- **RMS (Root Mean Square)**: Basically measures the average signal's power or loudness of time.
- **ZCR (Zero Crossing Rate)**: Counts how many times the audio changes signal from positive to negative and vice versa. If ZCR is high, the audio is noisy, sharp or high-pitched. And an audio with low ZCR is smooth, steady or low-pitched.
