# Awaaz

Awaaz is a Ruby gem for working with audio, from decoding to analysis, making it easier to process and understand sound in your projects.

## Installation

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add awaaz
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install awaaz
```
